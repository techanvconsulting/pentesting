# Infrastructure Pentesting Checklist

## Pre-engagement Phase

### 1. Define Objectives and Scope

- [ ] Define goals and objectives.
- [ ] Identify scope (systems, networks, assets).

### 2. Legal and Compliance

- [ ] Obtain proper authorization.
- [ ] Ensure compliance with legal guidelines.

### 3. Documentation and Information Gathering

- [ ] Collect network diagrams and asset inventories.
- [ ] Gather target infrastructure info.

## Reconnaissance Phase

### 4. Passive Reconnaissance

- [ ] Perform OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).
- [ ] Enumerate DNS records and subdomains.

### 5. Active Reconnaissance

- [ ] Use tools like Nmap for host discovery.
- [ ] Identify live hosts and open ports.
- [ ] Map network architecture.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### 6. Network Scanning

- [ ] Conduct comprehensive port scanning.
  - **Tool:** [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
  - **Command:** `nmap -p- target`
- [ ] Utilize version scanning.
  - **Tool:** [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
  - **Command:** `nmap -sV -p <port> target`

### 7. Web Application Scanning

- [ ] Scan web apps for vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Test for misconfigurations.

### 8. Network Services Assessment

- [ ] Assess services (e.g., FTP, SSH, SMB).
- [ ] Enumerate SNMP devices.

### 9. Wireless Network Assessment

- [ ] Identify Wi-Fi vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Test for weak encryption and rogue APs.

### 10. Cloud Infrastructure Assessment

- [ ] Assess cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- [ ] Check for exposed storage.

### 11. Physical Security Assessment

- [ ] Evaluate physical controls.

## Exploitation Phase

### 12. Exploitation

- [ ] Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Test for network-level exploits.
  - **Tool:** [Metasploit](https://www.metasploitunleashed.com/)
  - **Command:** `msfconsole`

### 13. Web Application Exploitation

- [ ] Exploit web app vulnerabilities.

### 14. Wireless Network Exploitation

- [ ] Attempt Wi-Fi attacks.

### 15. Cloud Infrastructure Exploitation

- [ ] Exploit cloud misconfigurations.

## Post-Exploitation Phase

### 16. Post-Exploitation

- [ ] Attempt privilege escalation.
- [ ] Exploit local vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Pivot to other systems.

### 17. Data Exfiltration

- [ ] Test for data exfiltration methods.

## Reporting Phase

### 18. Reporting

- [ ] Document findings and vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Include evidence and proof of concept.
- [ ] Provide remediation recommendations.
- [ ] Create a detailed pentest report.

### 19. Debriefing

- [ ] Conduct a client debriefing.
- [ ] Share insights and lessons learned.

## Remediation Phase

### 20. Remediation Assistance

- [ ] Offer assistance in fixing vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Verify remediation efforts.
