	- Setup manul proxy in android device and enter the ip and port of burp config.
	- Send Burpsuite certificate in android and install.
	- Burp configuration done.


3.  **Setting upFrida.**
	- Check androi architecture and download  accordingly [frida-server](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases)
		-  `adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi` // Check architecture
	- Download the burp certificate and renamed it as *cert-der.crt* 
	- Now send the frida-server and burp certificate in android location */data/local/tmp*
	- Done!

   ## Check packages

- `adb shell pm list packages`
- `adb shell pm list packages -f`
- `adb shell pm list packages | Select-String "camera"`
- `adb shell pm list packages | grep camera`

## SSL Pinning Bypass command



4. **SSL Unpinning using Frida**
	- Run frida sever in android 
		- `adb shell`
		- `cd /local/data/tmp`
		- `./frida-server`
	- Few more frida command
		- `/data/local/tmp # ps -e | grep frida-server`
		 - `adb shell "pm list packages -f"`
		 - `frida-ps -Uai //get identifire`
		 - `frida-ps -Ua` // list running applications pkg
	- Now finally run
		-  frida -U -f com.<pakage> -l ssl-fridascript.js
   
```bash
- `-f`: Specifies the target application package name (`com.zeptoconsumerapp`) to attach to.
- `-l`: Specifies the Frida script file (`fridascript.js`) to load and execute.
- `-U`: Specifies that the target device is connected over USB.
```

	- **SSL Unpinning using Exposed Modul**
		- Clone the the repository [Exposed-Modul](https://github.com/ac-pm/SSLUnpinning_Xposed.git)
		- `cd /SSLUnpinning_Xposed`
		- ` adb install mobi.acpm.sslunpinning_latest.apk`
		- Open in android and check for SSL unpinning.

5. Root Dedection Bypass Using Frida
	- `frida -U --codeshare dzonerzy/fridantiroot -f in.<package company>.<package name`
