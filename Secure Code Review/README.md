# Source Code Review 

What is Source Code Review?
>A secure code review is a line-by-line analysis of the source code of an application, usually performed to find any security risks overlooked during the pre or post-development phase. A secure code review aims to analyze an application's source code and determine whether it has any security vulnerabilities or flaws.

## Ethics and Morality
- [ ] Does this change make use of user data in a way that 
might raise privacy concerns?
- [ ] Does the change exploit behavioral patterns or human
weaknesses? 
- [ ] Might the code, or what it enables, lead to mental 
and physical harm for (some) users?

interact with each other, are appropriate measures
in place to prevent/limit/report harassment or abuse?
- [ ] Does this change lead to an exclusion of a certain

particularly those related to sensitive characteristics such as
race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, 
and political or religious belief?
- [ ] Does this code change introduce any algorithm, 
AI  or machine learning bias?


## Testing and Testability
- [ ] Is the code testable?
- [ ] Has the code change
- [ ] Have automated tests been added, or have related ones been updated to cover the change?
- [ ] Do the existing tests reasonably cover the code change (unit/integration/system tests)? 
- [ ] Are there some test cases, input or edge cases
that should be tested in addition?

## Readability
- [ ] Is the code easy to understand?
- [ ] Which parts were confusing to you and why?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
smaller methods?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
different function, method or variable names?
- [ ] Is the code located in the right
file/folder/package?
- [ ] Do you think certain methods should be
restructured to have a more intuitive control
flow?
- [ ] Is the data flow understandable?
- [ ] Are there redundant or outdated comments?
- [ ] Could some comments convey the message
better?

- [ ] Is there any commented-out code?

## Experts' Opinion
- [ ] Do you think a specific expert, like a security
expert or a usability expert, should look over
the code before it can be accepted?
