## Reconnaissance Phase

### 1. Reconnaissance

- [ ] Identify the target wireless networks and devices.
- [ ] Collect network diagrams and floor plans.
- [ ] Identify the wireless infrastructure and its specifications.

### 2. Wireless Network Identification

- [ ] Identify all visible wireless networks.
- [ ] Document SSIDs, encryption types, and signal strengths.

### 3. Wireless Network Profiling

- [ ] Determine the location of wireless access points (APs).
- [ ] Record MAC addresses of APs and clients.

## Wireless Scanning and Enumeration

### 4. Wireless Network Scanning

- [ ] Conduct active scanning to discover hidden networks.
   - **Tools:** [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/), [Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net/)

### 5. Wireless Client Enumeration

- [ ] Identify connected wireless clients.
   - **Tools:** [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/)

### 6. Wireless Network Mapping

- [ ] Create a visual map of wireless networks and devices.
- [ ] Document encryption types, channels, and SSIDs.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### 7. Wireless Network Vulnerabilities

- [ ] Test for common wireless vulnerabilities, such as WEP, WPA, or WPA2 vulnerabilities.
   - **Tools:** [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/), [Reaver](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/reaver)

### 8. Weak Passwords

- [ ] Test for weak wireless network passwords.
   - **Tools:** [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/), [Reaver](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/reaver)

### 9. Misconfigured Access Points

- [ ] Identify misconfigured APs and security settings.
- [ ] Test for open networks with no encryption.

### 10. WPS Vulnerabilities

- [ ] Assess vulnerabilities related to Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS).
   - **Tools:** [Reaver](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/reaver)

## Exploitation Phase

### 11. Wireless Network Exploitation

- [ ] Exploit discovered vulnerabilities to gain access to the target network.
   - **Tools:** [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/), [Reaver](https://tools.kali.org/wireless-attacks/reaver)

### 12. Rogue APs

- [ ] Deploy rogue access points and test if clients connect.
- [ ] Monitor traffic on rogue APs for potential data leakage.

### 13. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

- [ ] Attempt to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on wireless clients.
   - **Tools:** [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/)

## Post-Exploitation Phase

### 14. Maintain Access

- [ ] Establish persistence on the compromised network.
- [ ] Monitor network traffic for data exfiltration attempts.

### 15. Data Exfiltration

- [ ] Test for data exfiltration techniques.

## Reporting Phase

### 16. Documentation and Reporting

- [ ] Document findings, vulnerabilities, and exploited wireless networks.
- [ ] Include evidence, proof of concept, and recommended mitigations.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive wireless pentest report.
   - **Sample Template:** [Sample Pentest Report Template](https://example.com/report-template)

### 17. Debriefing

- [ ] Conduct a debriefing session with the client's team.
- [ ] Discuss findings, recommendations, and lessons learned.
