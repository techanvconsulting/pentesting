# IoT Penetration Testing Checklist

## Device Enumeration and Profiling

- [ ] Identify all IoT devices within the network.
  - **Tools:** [Nmap](https://nmap.org/), [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)
  - **Commands:** `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`

- [ ] Create an inventory of devices, including their make, model, firmware version, and location.
- [ ] Determine the purpose and criticality of each device.
- [ ] Categorize devices based on their functions (e.g., sensors, controllers, gateways).

## Network Security

- [ ] Analyze network segmentation and isolation for IoT devices.
  - **Tools:** [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), [Tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/)
  - **Commands:** `tcpdump -i eth0 -n -nn`

- [ ] Assess the effectiveness of firewall rules and access controls.
  - **Tools:** [Nmap scripting engine](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/)
  - **Commands:** `nmap -p 22 --script ssh-auth-methods <target>`

- [ ] Evaluate network traffic encryption and secure communication protocols.
  - **Tools:** Wireshark, [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
  - **Commands:** `wireshark`, `openssl s_client`

- [ ] Check for unnecessary open ports and services on IoT devices.
- [ ] Review VLAN configurations and access control lists (ACLs).

## Firmware and Software Assessment

- [ ] Examine IoT device firmware for vulnerabilities and signs of tampering.
  - **Tools:** [Binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk), [Firmware-Mod-Kit](https://github.com/rampageX/firmware-mod-kit)
  - **Commands:** `binwalk firmware.bin`

- [ ] Verify that firmware updates are signed and securely distributed.
- [ ] Check for hardcoded credentials in firmware or configuration files.
- [ ] Test for firmware rollback vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Ensure that software libraries and components are up to date.

## Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Test the strength of authentication mechanisms.
  - **Tools:** [Hydra](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/hydra)
  - **Commands:** `hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://<target>`

- [ ] Verify the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) for device management.
- [ ] Assess the effectiveness of access control policies.
- [ ] Check for insecure default credentials.

## Physical Security

- [ ] Evaluate physical security measures around IoT devices.
- [ ] Assess the vulnerability of device physical interfaces (e.g., USB ports).
- [ ] Verify that devices are protected against tampering and unauthorized access.

## Data Security

- [ ] Review data storage mechanisms on IoT devices.
- [ ] Test for data encryption in transit and at rest.
- [ ] Assess data integrity and tamper detection mechanisms.
- [ ] Verify that sensitive data is adequately protected.

## Cloud and Backend Services

- [ ] Assess the security of cloud services or backend servers connected to IoT devices.
- [ ] Review authentication and authorization mechanisms for cloud access.
- [ ] Check for proper data validation and sanitization in cloud interactions.
